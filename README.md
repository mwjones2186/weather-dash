  ## Description 

  Weather dash is a 5 day forcast generator based on a city search. It will display the temperature, wind, humidity and UVI index for said city. .

  It was a great project to get my feet wet with API calls and seeing how passing info from one API through another to get more information. It was also very interesting on using temprate literals. Being able to change a webdomain to take a new set of info and render something different. .

  Its a very simple weather app. Want to get out of town this weekend? Check the weather and pack your bags! .

  API calls, temprate literals and simple DOM manipulation. .

 

  ## Installation
  Clone the repo. Open index.html in the web browser or utilizing a live server in VS code. Then type a city and hit enter.

  ## Usage

  I actually used this app, or snippets of this code for a separate project in using weather to see if it was safe to have a fire. It was called Camp-Firecast. .

  Feedback. I am always working on improving my coding and modifying my code to be more scaleable. Also able to reduce redundant code. So feedback is always apreciated. Thank you!.

  ## Tests

  No formal tests just lots of trial and error. .
